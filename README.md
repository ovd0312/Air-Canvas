# Air-Canvas
A program which enables the user to draw by waving a colored bead in front of a camera. Achieved using color detection. 
The library OpenCV is used for color detection through the camera. Python was chosen as the language due to the ease of coding.
The target color for the bead can be manually set (and changed while the program is running) by the user.
